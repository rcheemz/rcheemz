## Featured Projects

### Battle of the Pirates  
**Unity | C# | TouchScript | Multi-Screen Interaction**

A 3D multiplayer action game developed for Edmonton Public Library‚Äôs massive 3-screen interactive Wall. Inspired by Wii Tanks, players take control of pirate ships and battle each other or NPC bots using drag-to-move mechanics and timed cannonfire. The game supports 1‚Äì3 players with real-time gesture recognition across a 3240x1920 pixel multi-touch setup.

 **Core Features:**
- Multiplayer gameplay across 3 large touchscreen panels
- Ships fire automatically and can ram into others to cause damage
- Scoring system based on hits and ship destruction
- Drag-and-release gesture for movement; tap for player joining
- Leaderboard and visual effects synced with game events
- 75-second rounds with auto-reset and countdown transitions

 **My Contributions:**
- Co-lead developer responsible for core mechanics: ship movement, drag-based control system, and gesture handling across screens
- Designed and modeled the **entire ship asset**, including cannon layout and visual styling
- Designed and integrated UI/UX for touch-based interaction
- Managed sound effects and visual synchronization (e.g., smoke, fire, explosions)
- Coordinated in-house testing for responsiveness, pacing, and user interface

 **Core Features:**
- Parsed and modeled thousands of property entries using custom Java classes
- Designed class structure to represent assessment details like location, property type, neighborhood, and market value
- Built methods to calculate statistical insights (e.g., average value by neighborhood, property count by type)
- Main program is a summary of key metrics and data trends

 **Skills Applied:**
- Encapsulation, modularity, and object composition
- Data aggregation and filtering with clean OOP design

###  Encrypted Email Network (CMPT 361)  
**Python | Socket Programming | RSA & AES Encryption**

A secure client-server email system built in Python that allows authenticated users to send and receive encrypted messages over a local network. Implements custom authentication, public-private key exchange (RSA), symmetric encryption (AES), and multi-client communication using sockets.

 **Core Features:**
- Custom `client.py` and `server.py` programs for secure messaging
- RSA key pair generation and exchange via `key_generator.py`
- AES encryption (ECB mode) for message confidentiality post-authentication
- Multi-client support (up to 5 simultaneous connections)
- Inbox handling, email viewing, and command-driven interaction
- Added hashing mechanism for message integrity and attack resistance

 **Security Layers:**
- RSA-encrypted credential transmission
- Server-generated AES session key sent to client and verified
- Enhanced version adds hash validation to mitigate MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks

 **Skills Applied:**
- Network programming with `socket`
- PyCryptodome RSA & AES encryption
- JSON-based credential handling
- Multi-threaded client handling
