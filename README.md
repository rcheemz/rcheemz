### 🏴‍☠️ Battle of the Pirates  
**Unity | C# | TouchScript | Multi-Screen Interaction**

A 3D multiplayer action game developed for Edmonton Public Library’s massive 3-screen interactive Wall. Inspired by Wii Tanks, players take control of pirate ships and battle each other or NPC bots using drag-to-move mechanics and timed cannonfire. The game supports 1–3 players with real-time gesture recognition across a 3240x1920 pixel multi-touch setup.

🧩 **Core Features:**
- Multiplayer gameplay across 3 large touchscreen panels
- Ships fire automatically and can ram into others to cause damage
- Scoring system based on hits and ship destruction
- Drag-and-release gesture for movement; tap for player joining
- Leaderboard and visual effects synced with game events
- 75-second rounds with auto-reset and countdown transitions

🎮 **My Contributions:**
- Co-lead developer responsible for core mechanics: ship movement, drag-based control system, and gesture handling across screens
- Designed and modeled the **entire ship asset**, including cannon layout and visual styling
- Designed and integrated UI/UX for touch-based interaction
- Managed sound effects and visual synchronization (e.g., smoke, fire, explosions)
- Coordinated in-house testing for responsiveness, pacing, and user interface

### 📡 Encrypted Email Network (CMPT 361)  
**Python | Socket Programming | RSA & AES Encryption**

A secure client-server email system built in Python that allows authenticated users to send and receive encrypted messages over a local network. Implements custom authentication, public-private key exchange (RSA), symmetric encryption (AES), and multi-client communication using sockets.

🧩 **Core Features:**
- Custom `client.py` and `server.py` programs for secure messaging
- RSA key pair generation and exchange via `key_generator.py`
- AES encryption (ECB mode) for message confidentiality post-authentication
